            <p class="his">In 1995, a person named Brendan Eich was given a task to design and develop 
                a prototype and programming language for the web browser for Netscape Navigations. 
                He came up with an initial draft in just 10 days and later on that initial draft 
                would somewhat conquer the world of web development. In Netscape Navigator 3.0 it 
                was renamed as JavaScript to lure java developers to develop on the web browser. 
                The draft was called mocha when it was first released but livescript later became 
                Netscape's top-secret tool for developing in Java.</p>
