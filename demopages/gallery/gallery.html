            <h2>NANOMEDICINE</h2>
            <P>Nanomedicine utilized nanotechnology, or the study of molecular structure 
                for <br>developing precise devices to advance biomedical research and clinical practice. <br>

             <br>Nanotechnology operates on atoms and molecules on the nano-meter scale, and by <br>controlling
                 the arrays and structure of substances, it exploits the unique characteristics<br> of nano-size
                  particles to create new, excellent characteristics of substances.</p>
                  
                  <h2 class="bio">3D BIOPRINTING</h2>
                  <p class="bioprint">3D Bioprinting is a form of additive manufacturing that uses cells and other 
                      biocompatible <br>materials as “inks”, also known as bioinks, to print living structures 
                      layer-by-layer which<br> mimic the behavior of natural living systems. <br>
                      <br>Over 120,000 people in the US alone are on waiting lists for organs, and others <br> 
                      experience chronic problems due to the long-term damaging effects of post-transplant<br>
                      immunosuppression. There’s a large and growing need for an alternative to the organ <br>
                      transplant waiting list. For pharmaceutical development, 3D bioprinting offers a means 
                      of<br> testing drugs faster, at a lower cost, and with better biological relevance to humans <br>
                      than animal testing. </p>

            <h2 class=" printing">The integration of 3D printing and children’s education</h2>
            <p>3D printing technology refers to the use of a 3D printer to connect the computer, 
                the<br> image formed in the computer, the use of powdery metal or plastic and other 
                adhesive<br> materials, by layer printing.<br>
            
                <br> Several advantages of using 3D printing technology for <br>educational product 
                production and classroom learning were demonstrated at CES 2020.<br>The principle 
                of 3D printers is similar to that of ordinary printers, except that the raw<br> 
                materials have changed from paper and graphite to metals and ceramics.</p>
            
                <h2 class="steam">STEAM-related products are in demand</h2>
                <p class="jimu">For the first time ever, Ubisoft demonstrated the newly developed 
                    JIMU PRO series, which<br> is a STEAM education product using artificial
                    intelligence technology. It provides PBL <br>(Project Based Learning), with
                    up-to-date scenarios that draw the learner in and develop <br>skills and contextual knowledge.
                    
                    Beijing based Bell.Ai exhibited BeBO, a smart classroom <br>solution provider. It is being developed 
                    using block-type innovation and interactive teaching<br> to perfectly integrate the curriculum system 
                    and the teaching system; it employs advanced <br>technologies such as artificial intelligence, IoT, 
                    and biometrics, integrating various intelligent<br> hardware and software.  </p>
