        <p class="p1" align="justify"> For those who don't know me, my name is Shaira Montojo, and I am Teresita Tan's granddaughter.<br>
            On behalf of my grandmother, my parents and the rest of our family, I want to thank you for visiting
            <br>this page that I made for my grandmother.</p>
        
        <p class="p2" align="justify">My grandmother lived a life that was full of joy, and happiness. whenever I think about her,<br>I remember
            how humorous, witty, and clever she was. Most of my childhood memories with her<br>are full with traces of singing
            and laughter. It was so much fun to be with her, she loved to laugh and to <br>have fun, we adored her.</p>
        
        <p class="p3" align="justify">She faced her life with intelligencem courage, and wit. When I was talking to some of her friends, I <br>heard
            more than anything else was how much fun she was to be around. We all remember how <br>lighthearted she was and how much
            she liked to enjoy herself.</p>
        
        <p class="p4" align="justify">Lola, I will always miss you. But I have so many wonderful memories of you. I'll always think of you with a smile.</p>
